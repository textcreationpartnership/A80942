         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thank God I can give you a good account of <hi>Basing:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Batteries placed, we setled the severall posts for the storm, Col: <hi>Dalbier</hi> was to be on the North side of the house next the Grange, Col. <hi>Pickering</hi> on his left hand, and Sir <hi>Hardres Wallers,</hi> and Col: <hi>Mountagues</hi> Regiments next him. VVe Stormed this morning after six of the Clock: The sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall for falling on, was the firing four of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170829:3"/>our Canon; which being done, our men fell on with great Resolution and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse: VVe took the two houses with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any considerable losse to our selves: Col: <hi>Pickering</hi> Stormed the new house, passed through, and got the gate of the old house; whereupon, they Summoned a Parley, which our men would not hear: In the mean time, Col: <hi>Mountagues,</hi> and Sir <hi>Hardres Wallers</hi> Regiments, assaulted the strongest works, where the Enemy kept his Court of Guard, which with great resolution they recovered, beating the enemy from a whole culverin, &amp; from that VVork; which having done, they drew their Ladders after them, and got <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er another VVork and the house wall, before they could enter in this: Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres Waller</hi> performing his duty with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and diligence, was shot on the arm,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170829:3"/>but not dangerous: VVe have had little losse; many of the Enemy our men put to the Sword, and some Officers of quality, most of the rest we have Prisoners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which the Marques and Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Peake,</hi> with divers other Officers, whom I have Ordered to be sent up to you. We have taken about ten piece of Ordnance, much Ammunition, and our Souldiers a good encouragement. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer to you to have this place slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for these Reasons; It will ask Eight hundred men to man it, it is no frontier, the Countrey is poor about it, the place exceedingly ruined by our Batteries and Morter-pieces, and a fire which fell upon the place since our taking it. If you please to take the Garrison at <hi>Farnham,</hi> some out of <hi>Chichester,</hi> and a good part of the Foot which were here under <hi>Dalbier,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170829:4"/>make a strong quarter at <hi>Newbery</hi> with three or four Troops of horse: I dare be confident, it would not only be a curb to <hi>Dennington,</hi> but a security and a Frontier to all these parts, inasmuch as <hi>Newbery</hi> lies upon the River, and will prevent any incursion from <hi>Dennington, Wallingford,</hi> or <hi>Farringdon</hi> into these parts, and by lying there will make the Trade most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure between <hi>Bristoll</hi> and <hi>London</hi> for all Carriages: And I believe the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Hantshire</hi> will with more cheerfulnes contribute to maintain a Garrison on the Frontier, then in their bowels, which will have lesse safety in it.</p>
            <p>Sir I hope not to delay, but march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the VVest to morrow, and to be as diligent as I may in my expedition thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I must speak my judgement to you, that if you intend to have your work car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170829:4"/>on, recruits of Foot must be had, and a course taken to pay your Army; else believe me Sir, it may not be able to answer the work you have for it to do. I entreated Coll: <hi>Hamond</hi> to wait upon you, who was taken by a mistake whilest we lay before this Garrison, whom God safely delivered to us, to our great joy, but to his losse of almost all he had which the Enemy took from him. The Lord grant that these mercies may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged with all thankfulnesse; God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly abounds in his goodnesse to us, and will not be weary, untill righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and peace meet, and that he hath brought forth a glorious work, for the happinesse of this poor Kingdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in desires to serve God and you with a faithfull heart,</p>
